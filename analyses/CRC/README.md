# Analysing STRs in colorectal cancer (CRC) sequencing data

Data used here are part of the EGAD50000000411 dataset in the human genome-phenome archive ([https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD50000000411](https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD50000000411)).

The dataset is described in this [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.26.582054v1.full).
The authors of the pre-print ran ConSTRain on their aligned WGS data and provided us with four VCF files: LMO (the original MSI tumor organoid cell line), 01-0 (4n clone), 05-0 (2n clone), and 07-0 (4n clone).
ConSTRain was run with CNV information for each of these samples.
